# GuessTheNumber
Nice little game where whoever plays it has to guess a random number generated by the computer. If you fail, you get to try again and it will tell you if it is high or lower. If you win you get a green screen with a congrats and there is also an highscore. It also includes a play again button that reset the entire game besides the highscore.
